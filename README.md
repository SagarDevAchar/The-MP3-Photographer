# The MP3 Photographer

An LSB2 Steganography Encoder which encodes MP3 Audio into PNG Images to be played by [**The PNG Musician**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/ThePNGMusician)

## About the project

This is secpnd part of the **Steganography Made Fun!** toolkit

The toolkit has three parts divided into three repositories:

- Part 1: [The TXT Hider](https://sagardevachar.github.io/TheTXTHider/)
- Part 2: [The MP3 Photographer](https://sagardevachar.github.io/TheMP3Photographer/) (This Repository)
- Part 3: [The PNG Musician](https://sagardevachar.github.io/ThePNGMusician/)

## Repository Structure

- `IN\` : This is where you place the JPG and MP3 files
- `SRC\` : Contains the Steganographically Encoded PNG Files
- `LICENSE` : GNU GPL v3.0 License for [The MP3 Photographer](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/TheMP3Photographer)
- `README.md` : Here you are!
- `install_requirements.bat` : Installs the necessary package requirements using `pip` (Requires `pip` access in `PATH`)
- `The MP3 Photographer.py` : Source Code

## Usage Instructions

1. Just let things be where they are (relatively)
1. Place the **JPG** files with `<song_name>.jpg` in the adjacent directory labeled `IN\`
1. Place the **MP3** files with `<song_name>.mp3` in the adjacent directory labeled `IN\` (Check the Restrictions below)
1. Run `The MP3 Photographer.py` using the IDE of your choice or via CMD using the `python "The MP3 Photographer.py"` command
1. Obtain the Steganographically Encoded PNG files in the `SRC\` Directory

Place the Custom PNG files generated by [**The MP3 Photographer**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/TheMP3Photographer) in the `SRC\` folder of [**The PNG Musician**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/ThePNGMusician) folder to play them
 
## Restrictions

Amount of data that can be steganograhically encoded in a particular image is limited. Both [**The MP3 Photographer**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/TheMP3Photographer) and [**The PNG Musician**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/ThePNGMusician) work on colour images of resolution `1280x720` with the 2 LSB bits in each channel of each pixel holding the MP3 file

Ultimately, the size of MP3 file is restricted to `1280 x 720 x 3 x 2 = 5,529,600 bits` or `675 kB`

I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to limit the MP3 file sizes into the restriction limits with the following settings:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maximum Duration</th>
    <td>1 minute</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Bit Rate Mode</th>
    <td>Preset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Quality</th>
    <td>Medium, 145-185 kbps</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Channel Mode</th>
    <td>Force Export to Mono</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Metadata</th>
    <td>Cleared</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Python Version:** 3.5+
- **Packages:** [TQDM](https://tqdm.github.io/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

You can install the required packages manually or by running the `install_requirements.bat`. You can always create a virtual environment to prevent your version critical installations from being modified (You need to switch to the virtual environment before running the batch file)

I do not own any rights to the images or music in the `IN\` directory. All rights are reserved by the respective artists and record labels
